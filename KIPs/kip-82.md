## Simple Summary
A renewal of the Governance Council(GC) reward structure due to abolition of the Gini coefficient.

## Abstract
In addition to traditional enterprises, Klaytn is expanding the Governance Council (GC) by bringing DAOs in response to the growth of nontraditional entities. Such a change in the GC ecosystem will restructure the entire Klaytn governance structure. Abolishing the current block proposal selection method based on the Gini coefficient and staking quantity, the new reward program alleviates the problem of providing insufficient compensation for the network contribution and block verification due to lack of staking. The instability of certain nodes with high staking amounts can result in poor network stability as a whole. The renewed structure provides 20% of GC rewards to block proposers and the rest to the stakers. This form is to reward the participants for providing network stability with node operation and financial contribution.

## Motivation
Klaytn has been compensating GC with block proposal rewards based on the quantity of staking and the Gini coefficient. This included rewards incurred by minting and gas fee generated by transactions. As mentioned in the [Klaytn 2.0 Lightpaper](https://klaytn.foundation/wp-content/uploads/Lightpaper.pdf), Klaytn is abolishing the Gini coefficient since this measure demotivates members from staking. Discontinuation of the Gini coefficient increases the risk to network stability due to the expanding reliance on certain nodes. This change ultimately calls for the revision of block proposer selection and reward structure. In an effort to enhance individual voting power and promote ultimate decentralization, we aim to accomplish the following changes:
- Ameliorate the risk that block creation depends on larger staker nodes
- Associate GC reward with the growth of the Klaytn ecosystem

## Specification

Block generation is rewarded for the node operations that are serving as public goods in the Klaytn network. CNs and PNs are in charge of block proposal and propagation while ENs are in charge of blockchain data inquiry based on an individual's needs. The infrastructure cost remains similar, enabling some fixed benefits. Therefore, fixed compensation will be equivalent to the sum of the transaction fee and an additional block compensation, which can be both inflationary and deflationary.

The block proposal method will be based on equal selection regardless of the staking amount. The current model provides a block generation reward based on staking amount and the Gini-coefficient. Until now, the Gini coefficient was utilized to alleviate the chance of an entity with more staking amount being selected as a block proposer. As this model provided a fairly equal chance to every participant, each node was promised a certain amount of rewards.

In the new method, the reward for node operation is required since the staking amount is not considered in the block proposer selection. Therefore, a certain percentage of the total reward amount will be placed as a node operation reward.

Node operators will also be compensated with the staking for enhancing network stability from an economic standpoint. The opportunity cost incurred from staking is rewarded based on inflation. In this system, inflation provides a tax-like common effect. Public users can also participate and receive rewards through the GC-run public staking program.

As of September 21st, 2022, of the 300 million KLAY that is minted annually, only 100 million KLAY goes to GC. The renewal separates GC reward into two components: block proposer reward and staking reward. The block proposer reward is compensating for node operation by providing 20% of the GC reward and 100% of gas fee resources from transactions. The staing reward is from 80% of the GC reward and is distributed based on GC staking amounts.

The relative ratio of 20% and 80% is a tentative value to be used in the Cypress mainnet. However, this ratio is defined as a governance paramter, so GC members can change the ratio through the governance process.

After the Magma hard fork, Klaytn has been burning the first half of the gas fee based on [the KIP-71 proposal](https://kips.klaytn.foundation/KIPs/kip-71) while the second half is distributed. The second half is distributed into GC reward, KGF and KIR.

In addition to changing the reward structure, this renewal will include burning the gas fee up to a threshold which is the size of block proposer reward. If the gas fee exceeds the threshold, remaining amount is rewarded to the block proposer. The KGF and KIR portion will be excluded from the gas fee.

### Klaytn node update

The Klaytn node will be updated according to the new reward policy. The CN reward is further split into proposer reward and staking reward. The staking reward is distributed among CNs proportionally to their staking amounts minus the minimum staking amount.

A new governance parameter is introduced to tune the new reward distribution algorithm. The initial value below will be used in the Cypress mainnet when KIP-82 is first applied. The parameter can be updated using the existing governance mechanism.

| Name                | Type   | Meaning                                                 | Initial Value |
|---------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `reward.kip82ratio` | string | The relative ratio between proposer and staking rewards | "20/80"       |

During integer arithmetics, minuscule remaining amounts may be emitted as by-products. The proposer gets the remainder from the staking share distribution, and KGF gets the the remainder from the distribution among proposer, stakers, KIR, KGF.

Below pseudocode illustrates the new reward distribution algorithm. Note: `//` is round down integer division.

The updated algorithm increases the balance of every GC member's reward account at every block. The performance impact should be reasonable since the number of GC members is significantly smaller than Klaytn's transaction processing capability.

### Reward JSON-RPC API

A new JSON-RPC method should be added to provide historic reward distribution details.

- Name: `klay_getRewards`
- Description: Returns allocation details of reward distribution at the specified block. If the parameter is not set, returns a breakdown of reward distribution at the latest block.
- Parameters
  1. `QUANTITY | TAG` - (optional) integer or hexadecimal block number, or the string "earlist" or "latest".
- Returns
  - `DATA`
    - `minted`: The amount minted
    - `totalFee`: Total tx fee spent
    - `burntFee`: The amount burnt
    - `proposer`: The amount for the block proposer
    - `stakers`: Total amount for stakers
    - `kgf`: The amount for KGF
    - `kir`: The amount for KIR
    - `rewards`: A mapping from reward recipient addresses to reward amounts
- Example
  ```
  // Request
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"klay_getRewards", "params":["0x64fe7e0"],"id":1}' https://api.baobab.klaytn.net:8651
  // Response
  {
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id":1,
    "result":{
      "minted": "6400000000000000000",
      "totalFee": "1075975000000000",
      "burntFee": "537987500000000",
      "proposer": "3200268993750000000",
      "stakers": "0",
      "kgf": "2560215195000000000",
      "kir": "640053798750000000"
      "rewards": {
        "0xa86fd667c6a340c53cc5d796ba84dbe1f29cb2f7": "3200268993750000000",
        "0x2bcf9d3e4a846015e7e3152a614c684de16f37c6": "2560215195000000000",
        "0x716f89d9bc333286c79db4ebb05516897c8d208a": "640053798750000000"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

## Expected Effect
The proposed GC reward mechanism is expected to produce the following changes:
- GC members increase individual staking amount.
- KLAY holders receive profit based on the staking amount of KLAY.
- Total Value Locked (TVL) of Klaytn increases.
- The total circulation reduces.

## Backward Compatibility
Klaytn nodes must be upgraded before `KORE_BLOCK_NUMBER` to correctly produce or verify blocks.
